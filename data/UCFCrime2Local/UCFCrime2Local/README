The directory is structured as follows:

-Txt_annotations: Folder with annotations in txt format;

-Test_split_AD.txt: IDs of clips used as training data in our experiments;

-Train_split_AD.txt: IDs of clips used as testing data in our experiments;

-Videos_from_UCFCrime.txt: IDs of clips we have selected from UCFCrime dataset.

Each video ID is composed by its action label (e.g. 'Arrest' or 'Burglary' and a unique number). We encourage to download the videos directly from UCFCrime website.

Annotations are compliant to Vatic format, described in the corresponding repository.
